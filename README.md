## Install Package

Let's take a look at how you can install this package into your Discord Bot Project.

`npm i discord.js-akinator --save`

For versions 3.0.0 and Above, you'll also need discord.js v13. This can easily be installed with:

`npm i discord.js@13 --save`

For versions earlier than 3.0.0, you'll need discord.js v12. However it is recommended you update to patch bugs and security vulnerabilities, as well as get the newest features from this package!

`npm i discord.js@12 --save`

## Example Code

```js
const { Client, Intents } = require("discord.js");
const akinator = require("discord.js-akinator");
const client = new Client({ intents: [Intents.FLAGS.GUILDS, Intents.FLAGS.GUILD_MESSAGES] });

client.on("ready", () => {
    console.log("Bot is Online")
});

const PREFIX = "!";

//Example options

const language = "en"; //The Language of the Game
const childMode = false; //Whether to use Akinator's Child Mode
const gameType = "character"; //The Type of Akinator Game to Play. ("animal", "character" or "object")
const useButtons = true; //Whether to use Discord's Buttons
const embedColor = "#1F1E33"; //The Color of the Message Embeds

client.on("messageCreate", async message => {
    if(message.content.startsWith(`${PREFIX}akinator`)) {
        akinator(message, {
            language: language, //Defaults to "en"
            childMode: childMode, //Defaults to "false"
            gameType: gameType, //Defaults to "character"
            useButtons: useButtons, //Defaults to "false"
            embedColor: embedColor //Defaults to "RANDOM"
        });
    }
});

client.login("Discord Bot Token")
```
